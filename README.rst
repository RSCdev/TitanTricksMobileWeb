TitanTricksWeb Readme
======================

TitanTricks is Titanium Mobile project, full of reusable code samples and tricks
with a didactic aim, oriented to begginers and intermediate level users. 

The original project was compatible with android and iOS, but some samples only work on iOS (indicated on each case).

Now I'm porting the project to Titanium mobileweb. By now, I'm maintaining a separated project but I'll probably merge in one unique project.

Original project (iPhone, Android): https://github.com/jaraen/TitanTricks

Live demo: http://www.titantricks.com/mobile

This repo: https://github.com/jaraen/TitanTricksMobileWeb
